          India wears her beauty in the colorful textiles, breathtaking ornaments, and inspiring stories that come alive in her streets. 
          There is magic in the hands that work the loom, in the eyes that pore over a needle, in the brushstrokes that paint life. 
          And yet few things can sum it all up, can capture the essence in a box. 
          At Jijivisha, we have begun a fascinating journey, a humble attempt to bring India a little closer to the world.
